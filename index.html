      <p class="about" id="img-caption">Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, is a wealthy industrialist and genius
        inventor. He is the CEO of Stark Industries, a company that produces advanced weaponry. Stark was kidnapped by
        terrorists and forced to build a weapon of mass destruction. Instead, he built a suit of power armor and escaped
        captivity, becoming the armored superhero known as Iron Man.</p>
      <p class="about" id="tribute-info">
        As Iron Man, Stark uses his technology to fight against evil and protect the world. Despite his initial
        reluctance to share his secret identity, Stark eventually joins the Avengers, a team of superheroes, and helps
        save the world from numerous threats. He is known for his quick wit, sarcasm, and intelligence, which often
        leads to humorous moments in his battles against villains. Stark is also remembered for his famous line, "I love
        you 3,000," which he says to his daughter in the film "Avengers: Endgame".
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        Throughout his journey, Stark battles his own demons and personal flaws, but remains a selfless and courageous
        hero until his death. Despite facing numerous challenges, he always puts the safety of others before his own and
        remains committed to using his power for good. Stark's legacy as a hero and inventor continues to inspire
        people, making him one of the most beloved and iconic characters in the Marvel universe.
